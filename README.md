Explanation: My tutor and I wokred on the challenge together and started on my local computer instead of creating the repo on github and then cloning that to my local computer. The original repo had a couple of commits. I know to commit more often now, but when I was originally working on this with my tutor we made one big commit at the end of the session, where we mainly worked on index.js and a little bit of the generateMarkdown.js file. I was having issues pushing my local project to github and was in a time crunch so i instead created a new github repo, cloned that to my local comp, and then copied and pasted my files from my original local project into my newly cloned repo.
